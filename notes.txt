# Step one :
    create react-native-config.js file and inside it we define the folder of fonts 

# Step two (Praper owr redux enviroment) :
    create store folder and inside it create two folders /actions and reducers/
    these folders which we will put the redux component inside them
    -First create folder types and inside it create types.js which contain the constants of
     type of actions
    -Second inside reducers :=> we create two files listReducer.js and taskReducer.js
    (رامي نفس الشرح بملف التاسك ريدوسر نفسو بينطبق على الليست ريدوسر)   
    -Third inside actions : => we create two files listActions.js and taskActions.js
            (نفس الشرح على التاسك اكشن بينطبق على الليست اكشن)    
    -in the store folder (root folder of redux) create index.js which contain combineReducers
     that we just created

#step Three  :
    edit the index.js but be attention about this file index.js which exist in the root folder
    of our project not any other index.js
    -in this file we import our store from store folder and import React from 'react'
# Step Four :
    -Create utils folder which contain index.js and inside it 
            import { Dimensions } from 'react-native';
     and define the width and height off our phone screen
# Step Five :
    -Create style folder which contain globle.js this file contain the style of our app 
# Step six :
    -Create constants folder and inside it index.js which conatin our constants and colors we 
     we will use in our app
# Step eight :
    -Create folder screens :
      inside it create HomeScreen.js - ListScreen.js - TaskScreen.js - AddTaskScreen.js -AddListScreen.js
      these screen of our app
# Step severn :
    -Create navigation folder and inside it we create AppNavigation.js which contain the 
        definition of our screen and  enable us to move between them
